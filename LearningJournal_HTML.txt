HTML Learning Journal

1) Git and GitHub
Before I start learning HTML, I wanted to learn a little bit about Git and GitHub. I used two youtube videos for this:

Git, GitHub, & GitHub Desktop for beginners

Git is a version control system. It enables me to revert changes and that can be very useful in any type of coding, especially web programming. I also like learning about Git and GitHub, as it is a necessary tool in many jobs in this profession.

Git - Version control system
GitHub - Website for hosting Git repositories
GitHub Desktop - GUI software tool with simplified Git commands
Git Bash - Shell tool for Git command line

This video explains the use of GitHub Desktop. I will be using Git Bash and command line for these homeworks.

I'll be using a lot of Git commands that are explained in this video:
git init - initialize Git repository
git add - save changes (git add index.html i.e or git add . (save everything))
git commit -m 'message' - commit the changes
git log - log of changes
git checkout [commit id] - go back to that commit
git remote add origin - connect local repository to the one on GitHub
git push -u origin main - push commits to the GitHub
git checkout -b 'name' - create 'name' branch
git branch - show branches
pull request is request for changes on GitHub
git pull origin master - pull the changes from the GitHub
all the others linux commands such as cd, ls, touch, rm, and such
