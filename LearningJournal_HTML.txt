HTML Learning Journal

1) Git and GitHub
Before I start learning HTML, I wanted to learn a little bit about Git and GitHub. I used two youtube videos for this:

Git, GitHub, & GitHub Desktop for beginners

Git is a version control system. It enables me to revert changes and that can be very useful in any type of coding, especially web programming. I also like learning about Git and GitHub, as it is a necessary tool in many jobs in this profession.

Git - Version control system
GitHub - Website for hosting Git repositories
GitHub Desktop - GUI software tool with simplified Git commands
Git Bash - Shell tool for Git command line

This video explains the use of GitHub Desktop. I will be using Git Bash and command line for these homeworks.

I'll be using a lot of Git commands that are explained in this video:
git init - initialize Git repository
git add - save changes (git add index.html i.e or git add . (save everything))
git commit -m 'message' - commit the changes
git log - log of changes
git checkout [commit id] - go back to that commit
git remote add origin - connect local repository to the one on GitHub
git push -u origin main - push commits to the GitHub
git checkout -b 'name' - create 'name' branch
git checkout 'name' - switch to a branch
git branch -d 'name' - delete 'name' branch
git branch - show branches
pull request is request for changes on GitHub
git pull origin main - pull the changes from the GitHub
git status - check the status of the repository
all the others linux commands such as cd, ls, touch, rm, and such

2) HTML
I'll be using W3 Schools for learning HTML:

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
There are a lot of HTML elements. HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
<tagname>Content...</tagname>

Here, I will put elements that I encounter in my learning:

<title>'name'</title> - HTML page title
<head></head> - contains meta information
<html></html> - root element of HTML page
<!DOCTYPE html> - declaration that the document is HTML5 document
<body></body> - document's body content
<h1...6></h1...6> - heading
<p></p> - paragraph
<br> - nothing (empty element)
